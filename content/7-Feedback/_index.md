### General Feedback

**1. Working Environment**  
The working environment at FCJ is friendly and open. Everyone is willing to help whenever I run into issues, even outside working hours. The workspace is tidy and comfortable, which makes it easier to stay focused. One area that could be improved is the wiring setup at the desks — organizing power cables and outlets more neatly would make the space safer and more aesthetically pleasing.

**2. Support from Mentors and Admin Team**  
My mentor provided clear and detailed explanations, and always encouraged me to ask questions when something was unclear. I appreciate that I was allowed to try solving tasks on my own first before receiving guidance, as it helped me learn more effectively. The admin team was also very supportive with procedures and documentation, making the onboarding process smooth. Overall, the communication with both mentor and admin felt natural and pressure-free.

**3. Relevance to My Academic Background**  
Working with cloud technologies was mostly new to me. However, the internship allowed me to apply some of my existing knowledge while also identifying gaps that I needed to fill. This combination helped me strengthen my technical foundation and understand the direction I want to pursue more clearly.

**4. Opportunities for Learning & Skill Development**  
During the internship, I gained hands-on experience with various AWS services, improved my teamwork abilities, and learned how to communicate more professionally in a corporate environment. My mentor also shared many real-world insights that helped me better understand what skills are essential in the cloud field.

**5. Team Culture and Collaboration**  
The team culture at FCJ is very positive. People respect each other, work seriously, and support one another regardless of position or seniority. When there were urgent tasks, everyone contributed to solving the problem together. This made me feel included and valued, even as an intern.

**6. Policies and Benefits for Interns**  
FCJ provides internship allowance and is flexible with schedules when needed. Being able to attend internal events and training sessions is a big advantage, as these activities expand our learning beyond day-to-day tasks.

### Additional Questions

- **What I appreciated the most:**  
  I enjoyed having the chance to join various events — from product introduction sessions to hands-on labs and gameday activities. These experiences helped me understand AWS services in a more practical way.

- **What I think could be improved:**  
  Some documents are outdated and no longer suitable for practice, so it would be helpful to update them. Also, clearer guidelines for writing worklogs and event reports would make things easier for new interns.

- **Would I recommend others to intern here?**  
  Yes, but it depends on the person. If they are self-motivated, disciplined, and able to work well in a team, then I would definitely recommend FCJ as a great environment for growth.

### Suggestions & Expectations

- FCJ could consider offering more short technical workshops on AWS, coding best practices, or interview preparation.  
- I hope the company continues organizing events, as they are genuinely helpful and engaging.  
- I would love to have the opportunity to participate in real projects for deeper hands-on experience if suitable.
