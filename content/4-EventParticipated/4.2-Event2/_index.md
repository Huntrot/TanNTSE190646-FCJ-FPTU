## Report: “[AWS GenAI Builder Club] AI-Driven Development Life Cycle: Reimagining Software Engineering”

### Purpose of the Event
- Introduce the **AI-DLC (AI-Driven Life Cycle)** methodology in software development.  
- Clarify the benefits of applying AI across the entire product development lifecycle.  
- Present **Kiro.dev** – an AI IDE supporting the journey from idea to final product.  

---

### Speaker List
- **Toan Huynh** – Specialist SA  
- **My Nguyen** – Sr. Prototyping Architect, AWS ASEAN  

---

### Key Content

#### AI-DLC Methodology
- A new approach to software development by integrating AI in every stage: ideation → design → coding → testing → deployment.  
- Helps reduce repetitive tasks, accelerate development, and support rapid prototyping.  

#### Kiro.dev – The AI IDE
- An integrated AI-powered development tool that helps users build applications from prototype to production.  
- Automatically generates structured documents (plan.md, inception folder) and supports task management and prompt refinement.  

---

### Key Learnings

#### Concept & Application of AI-DLC
- Distinguish between **AI-DLC** (methodology) and **Kiro.dev** (execution tool).  
- AI-DLC fits small-scale projects and experiments; Kiro.dev supports real-world execution.  

#### Prompt Template in AI-DLC
- Define roles clearly.  
- Outline plans and AI tasks.  
- Organize documents under the **/inception/** folder.  
- If prompts are not optimal, let AI generate first, then refine or test with another model.  

#### Insights from Speakers
- Human developers should remain **owners** who review and verify AI output.  
- Combine time-saving AI tools with quality control.  

---

### Takeaways
- AI-DLC can be applied to learning and group projects to speed up workflow.  
- Best results come from combining **AI assistance** with **human validation**.  
- Kiro.dev offers a new pathway for ideation and prototyping in product development.
