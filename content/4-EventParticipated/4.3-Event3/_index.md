### Key Highlights

#### Data Science on AWS
- Overview of the **Machine Learning Workflow**:  
  *Data Collection → Data Preparation & Cleaning → Feature Engineering → Model Training → Evaluation → Deployment → Monitoring*  
- Demonstrated **Amazon SageMaker** for secure, automated model training and deployment.  

#### Amazon Comprehend
- NLP service extracting insights from text: *Entities, Sentiment, Topics, Syntax, Document Classification*.  
- Useful for analyzing feedback, reviews, or social media.  

#### Amazon Rekognition
- Image/video analysis detecting faces, objects, emotions, and text.  
- Typical workflow: *Upload → S3 → Lambda → Rekognition → DynamoDB/Elasticsearch*.  
- Helps automate media tagging and content analysis.  

#### Amazon Lex
- Build **intelligent chatbots** using voice/text.  
- Integrates with Lambda and DynamoDB.  
- Ideal for automated assistants and customer support.  

#### SageMaker & AutoML
- Supports **Scikit-learn, TensorFlow, PyTorch**, or custom Docker containers.  
- No-code AutoML via **SageMaker Studio/Canvas**.  
- Easy deployment via **API Endpoints**.
