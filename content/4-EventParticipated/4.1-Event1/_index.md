### Key Highlights
- **GenAI trends**: AWS emphasized that GenAI is not just a technology but a driver for enterprise restructuring, from customer service to data analytics.  
- **Modern data services**: AWS analytics services (Athena, Redshift Serverless, Glue, etc.) are **serverless**, freeing users from infrastructure management.  
- **Vector database**: A major topic, enabling semantic search and practical GenAI applications.  
- **Amazon SageMaker**: New features make it easier to train/infer AI models at scale with cost efficiency.  
- **Amazon Bedrock & AgentCore**: Demonstrated building AI applications using foundation models without managing infrastructure, while AgentCore enables **multi-task AI agents**.  
- **Vietnam case studies**: Enterprises shared success stories of applying GenAI in financial market analytics, QA testing, and developing apps with tens of millions of downloads.

### Personal Experience & Lessons Learned

- **Personal workshop idea**: Inspired by the **producer-consumer data pipeline** and serverless services, I plan to organize a small workshop on **“Producer and Consumer Data”**, leveraging **AWS Free Tier** to demonstrate cloud data flow without infrastructure costs.  

- **Vector database**: This was my first deep dive into how vector databases power **semantic search** in GenAI. I see strong potential to apply it in an internal chatbot (FAQ) project.  

- **Serverless data analytics**: I was impressed that most AWS data analytics services are serverless, which reduces operational burden—perfect for small teams like ours.  

- **Amazon SageMaker**: Gained clearer understanding of the full ML lifecycle (labeling → training → deployment), which can be applied when scaling AI models.  

- **Amazon Bedrock & AgentCore**: I found AgentCore particularly exciting as it helps build **multi-agent AI systems**, opening a new research path for developing AI-powered market data analysis tools.  

- **Networking & new opportunities**: The event also introduced me to **AI-DLC Unicorn Gym**, an upcoming event focused on AI and startups. I plan to attend to further expand my knowledge and network.

### Outcomes
- Defined a clear idea for a personal workshop on **Producer-Consumer Data** using AWS Free Tier.  
- Deeper understanding of **vector databases** and **serverless data analytics** for real-world use.  
- Learned how to leverage **Amazon SageMaker** and **Bedrock** in AI projects.  
- Improved career direction and expanded networking through AWS community events.
