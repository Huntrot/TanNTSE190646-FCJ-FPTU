### Key Highlights

#### 1. DevOps Mindset
- Focus on a **collaboration-first** culture emphasizing automation, continuous observability, and fast feedback loops.  
- Overview of the DevOps model integrating Development – Operations – QA – Security.  

#### 2. CI/CD Pipeline (The section I learned the most from)
- Kha presented a clear **Pipeline Workflow** using Lucidchart, covering:  
  - GitHub Version Control  
  - Peer Review & Pull Requests  
  - Automated Testing & QA  
  - Deployment across multiple environments (Dev → QA → Pre-Prod → Prod)  
- This helped me clearly visualize real-world deployment workflows.  

#### 3. DevOps on AWS – Hands-on Workshop
- Built a CI/CD pipeline using AWS services such as:  
  - **CodeCommit / GitHub**  
  - **CodeBuild**  
  - **CodePipeline**  
  - **Elastic Beanstalk / ECS**  
- Strong emphasis on real, end-to-end DevOps practice.  

#### 4. Monitoring & Observability
- Practical demonstrations using **Amazon CloudWatch**: Logs, Metrics, Dashboards, Alarms.  
- Error tracing and performance insights with **AWS X-Ray**:  
  - Service map visualization  
  - Bottleneck identification  
  - Request tracing  
- This significantly deepened my understanding of system observability.
