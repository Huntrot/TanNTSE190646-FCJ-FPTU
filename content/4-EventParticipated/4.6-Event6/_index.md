## Key Highlights

### 1. First-Time GameDay Experience
- This was my **first GameDay**, and it was both challenging and exciting.  
- Learned how challenges progress from Beginner → Intermediate → Advanced.  
- Understood how “lane division” helps optimize the 120-minute gameplay.

### 2. Agentic AI & Bedrock
- Understood the agent workflow:
  - Planning → Action → Evaluation  
  - Memory storage & context retention  
  - Code Interpreter in AgentCore  
- Learned how to configure Guardrails and Knowledge Bases.

### 3. Prompting Techniques
Four techniques impressed me the most:
- **Zero-shot**  
- **Few-shot**  
- **Chain of Thought (CoT)**  
- **Mini Kahoot** – fun & competitive knowledge refresh  

### 4. Teamwork Spirit
- Learned how to hand off tasks effectively.  
- Team coordination helped us clear advanced challenges in time.  
- Realization: **AI is powerful, but a coordinated team is even stronger.**

## Personal Experience & Lessons Learned
- Improved task assignment based on strengths.  
- More confident in using AI Agents, Bedrock, and DynamoDB practically.  
- Understood system observability with AgentCore + Dynatrace.  
- Developed fast-reaction strategies under pressure.  
- Strengthened prompting skills for Foundation Models.

---

## Achievements
- Gained a concrete understanding of **Agentic AI workflows** on AWS.  
- More proficient with Amazon Bedrock, AgentCore, and DynamoDB.
