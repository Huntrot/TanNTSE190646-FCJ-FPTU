### Week 6 Achievements:

- **Completed practical exercises for Modules 6 and 7:**
  + Module 06-lab05: Gained proficiency in **creating and managing Amazon RDS (MySQL)** — including configuring subnet groups, security groups, and connection endpoints.  
  + Encountered technical issues with Module 06-lab43 — recorded and postponed execution.  
  + Module 07-lab35: Practiced **building a Data Lake on AWS** using S3, Glue, and Athena for managing and querying unstructured data.  
  + Module 07-lab40: Performed **cost and performance analysis** using AWS Glue and Athena; applied filtering to optimize query efficiency.  
  + Module 07-lab60: Worked with **Amazon DynamoDB**, practicing CRUD operations, Global Secondary Index (GSI), and auto-scaling configuration.

- **Researched migration from DynamoDB to RDS (MySQL)** for the group proposal:
  + Compared pros and cons of NoSQL vs. Relational Databases in AWS environments.  
  + Proposed a migration strategy using **AWS DMS (Database Migration Service)** and noted schema conversion considerations.

- **Updated the team project’s system architecture diagram:**
  + Added data flow connections between the application layer and RDS database.  
  + Clarified interactions among AWS services: S3, Lambda, API Gateway, and CloudFront.  
  + Standardized notation and color scheme to distinguish roles of each component.

- **Attended the [Data Science on AWS – Unlocking the Power of Data with Cloud Computing]** event at FPTU Hall:
  + Gained insights into how **AWS supports large-scale data processing (Data Lake, Machine Learning pipelines)**.  
  + Understood the connection between data analytics and AI/ML services like SageMaker.

- **Midterm Review:**
  + Reinforced knowledge through two key videos:  
    ▫️ *“What is the AWS Well-Architected Framework?”* – Overview of AWS’s five pillars of good architecture.  
    ▫️ *“AWS re:Invent 2022 - Security Pillar @ Scale”* – Explained key principles of operating secure large-scale AWS environments.  
  + Summarized main points to prepare for the **Midterm Assessment**.
