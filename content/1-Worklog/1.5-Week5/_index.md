### Week 5 Achievements:

- **Completed 100% of the individual workshop**, including all hands-on exercises from Modules 1 to 6.  
  + Fully implemented AWS services such as S3, EC2, IAM, Lambda, DynamoDB, and CloudWatch.  
  + Practiced cross-service integration to build a basic automation workflow.  
  + Identified and resolved real-world issues related to IAM Policy, Bucket Policy, and Function Permissions.

- **Group meeting to finalize the Proposal:**  
  + Identified **core AWS services** for the project (S3, Lambda, API Gateway, DynamoDB, CloudFront, IAM, and SNS).  
  + Divided the team: one sub-team responsible for **system architecture diagram**, and another for **writing the Proposal document**.  
  + Agreed on the overall workflow and the scope of features to be included in the proposal.

- **Completed the data architecture diagram for the Proposal**, illustrating data collection, storage, processing, and distribution flows using native AWS services.

- **Started studying Module 6 theory**, focusing on:  
  + Advanced security and access management.  
  + Resource monitoring and alert configuration using CloudWatch and CloudTrail.  
  + Applying AWS system administration best practices at scale (multi-account, multi-region setups).

- **Consolidated all knowledge from Modules 1 → 6**, and created a “Comprehensive AWS Notes” file to prepare for the **Phase 1 evaluation** of the course.
