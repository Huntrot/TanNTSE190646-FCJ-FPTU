During my internship at **AMAZON WEB SERVICES VIETNAM COMPANY LIMITED** from **September 6, 2025** to **November 28, 2025**, I had the opportunity to learn, practice, and apply the knowledge I acquired in school to a real working environment.  
I participated in a small project on an **E-commerce Platform for Bird Enthusiasts**, which provides curated products such as bird food, toys, cages, and decorative accessories suitable for species like Red-Whiskered Bulbul, Parrots, Budgerigars, and Oriental Magpie-Robins. Through this project, I improved my **self-learning and working discipline, teamwork and communication skills, periodic reporting, and problem-solving mindset**.

In terms of work attitude, I always strived to complete my assigned tasks well, follow company rules, and actively communicate with colleagues to enhance work efficiency.
